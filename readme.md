# Parametric markets

Parametric is a marketplace for fully collateralized parametric insurance alternative, where risk is priced by market forces, funded by liquidity providers, and settled automatically on-chain. Instead of relying on centralized insurers that privately maintain actuarial models, liquidity reserves, and claims control, Parametric replaces them with open market dynamics governed by smart contracts.

Each event or market represents a shared risk pool where two forces interact directly: users seeking protection and liquidity providers (LPs) competing to underwrite risk in exchange for yield. This competition is not purely financial—LPs bring their own probabilistic beliefs about the underlying event, contributing to a collective, on-chain intelligence that continuously updates prices through supply and demand.

Premiums evolve dynamically as a direct reflection of market sentiment. When demand for coverage rises faster than available collateral, premiums increase to attract new liquidity. Conversely, when LPs perceive the event as less likely and deploy more capital, premiums fall. Every policy is fully collateralized, ensuring solvency and eliminating counterparty risk by design.

Parametric transforms insurance from a trust-based, opaque system into an open, data-driven market where risk is priced transparently, executed automatically, and optimized collectively by the participants themselves.
